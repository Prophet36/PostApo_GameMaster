# PostApo_GameMaster
Written in Test Driven Development style, small Python application for Game Master controlling custom Role-Playing Game set in fictional post apocalyptic world.

Development of this project focuses firstly on creating and testing necessary classes (and interfaces) to set up a working program logic and backend. When this is done, console-based interfaces will be developed (menu navigation, output printing, etc), while finally developing graphical interface for the application.
